## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to be a place for code review/discussion with other Madison Game Dev community members. I structured this as a bare repo and a collection of Pull Requests, since PRs facilitate discussing code. My plan is to leave the PRs open in perpetuity so it's easy to see and add to the discussions.

## Notes on the code
I am a C#/Unity game developer that usually works solo, so I don't usually have the opportunity to get feedback from people. I figured doing these little challenges for Advent of Code would be a good starting point for getting feedback. I'm more interested in feedback regarding code elegance and readability over performance. But with that said, if there are any large performance concerns with any solutions here please do tell!
